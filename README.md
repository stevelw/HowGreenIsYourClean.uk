# How Green Is Your Clean?

**A work in progress frontend for the [Official Carbon Intensity API for Great Britain](https://carbonintensity.org.uk)**

Hosted at [howgreenisyourclean.uk](https://howgreenisyourclean.uk).

I am in the middle of building this as a portfolio project while on the _[Northcoders](https://northcoders.com) JavaScript full-stack course_.

- The runtime environment is **browser based**
- Uses the **React** framework

## How to run and test locally

A built version is available at [howgreenisyourclean.uk](https://howgreenisyourclean.uk). However, if you wish to build it yourself:

1. Clone the repo from [github.com/stevelw/howgreenisyourclean.uk](https://github.com/stevelw/howgreenisyourclean.uk]

   `git clone https://github.com/stevelw/howgreenisyourclean.uk`

2. Install the development dependencies

   `npm install -d`

3. Build using Vite

   `npm run build`

   Alternatively, a [CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com) build configuration is included.
